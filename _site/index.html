	<h2>Chef Jeff Woolley</h2>
	<p>Chef Jeff Woolley graduated, with distinction, from the Culinary Institute of America in the early '90's. 

From that foundation, and over the past 25+ years, he has gained experience working in some of the 

finest kitchens, and with some of the most talented chefs, in the country. From his roots in Buffalo, NY 

to a decade spent in the low-country of South Carolina, Chef Woolleyâ€™s focus, even before it was trendy, 

was to seek out the finest, fresh local ingredients and to utilize them in straightforward, yet artistic 

presentations.  Operating from the mindset that food can be both humble and extremely special, Chef 

Woolley takes great pride in focusing on the marriage of years of experience and new ideas, quietly 

contemplating research, patience and art, with the goal of providing every guest with an exceptional 

experience and an incredible, unpretentious meal.</p>
